## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to use historical customer data to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit. This prediction can help banks optimize marketing campaigns and improve customer targeting.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on various customer attributes and interactions with the bank. Key features include:
- **Age**: Customer age
- **Job**: Type of job
- **Marital**: Marital status
- **Education**: Education level
- **Default**: Credit default status
- **Housing**: Housing loan status
- **Loan**: Personal loan status
- **Contact**: Contact communication type
- **Campaign Data**: Details of previous marketing campaigns
- **Target**: Whether the customer subscribed to the term deposit (Yes/No)

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Detailed EDA to uncover insights and visualize data patterns.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Importing and cleaning the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualizations and statistical summaries.
3. **Model Building**: Training and tuning machine learning models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using various evaluation metrics.
